    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h3>Service Agent in logistics, based in Belgium</h3>
    <div class="about-me-para">
      <p>
        Hey there! My name is Anush Arutunian, I'm the oldest in my family and
        have one 1 little sister and brother. I have 3 main passions, which are
        movies, animals and food.
        <br />
        By day, I work as a Service Agent at Lineas. My work mainly consiste of
        resolving issues and inform the client if anything happens.
        <br />
        Movies are my ultimate escape. I find immense joy in exploring diverse
        cinematic worlds, unraveling stories, and appreciating the art of
        filmmaking. From thrilling adventures to heartfelt dramas, I'm always up
        for a movie night.
      </p>
      <p>
        Animals hold a special place in my heart. Their innocence and
        unconditional love never fail to brighten my day. Whether it's spending
        time with my pets or volunteering at animal shelters, I cherish every
        moment with these furry companions.<br />
        <br />
        Food is not just a necessity for me; it's a delightful journey. I love
        experimenting with flavors, trying new cuisines, and savoring unique
        dishes. Food, for me, is a celebration of culture and creativity.
        <br />In my free time, you'll often find me engrossed in the pages of a
        good book. I have a deep love for literature and the worlds it opens up.
        There's something magical about getting lost in a well-written story.
